        <h2>Basketball</h2>
        <p>Basketball is a fast-paced team sport played between two teams of five players. The goal is to score points by shooting
        the ball through the opponent’s hoop while preventing them from scoring. Players use skills like dribbling, passing, and
        shooting to move the ball and create opportunities. It requires teamwork, speed, and strategy. Basketball is enjoyed
        worldwide and helps build fitness, coordination, and cooperation.</p>
